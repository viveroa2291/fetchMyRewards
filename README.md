# fetchMyRewards

This is my submission for the Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise. 

I did this in Android Studio and to run this, you need to have Android Studio downloaded and clone the project and pull it down on Anrdoid Studio. 

From there, you should be able to have access to the whole repository and run the app on the emulator. 

When testing, it should display the list of an id, listId, and Name (which are item #'s). 

I did them in a ListView and ordered them by group starting with 1,
and then ordered each category by the Item # starting from the lowest to the highest.
